Closest Pair Problem

The Closest Pair Problem is a fundamental problem in computational geometry and computer science that involves finding the two closest points in a set of given points in a Euclidean space. The problem has a wide range of applications in various fields such as computer graphics, pattern recognition, image processing, and geographic information systems.
Problem Statement

Given a set of n points in a d-dimensional space, find the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance between them.
Time Complexity

The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time using a brute-force approach, but more efficient algorithms have been developed with a lower time complexity, such as the divide-and-conquer algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).
Applications

In practice, the closest pair problem is used in a variety of applications such as:

    Image processing, where it can be used to detect edges in an image
    Geographic information systems, where it can be used to find the closest pair of cities or landmarks.

Research

In research, the closest pair problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Some of the well-known algorithms are:
